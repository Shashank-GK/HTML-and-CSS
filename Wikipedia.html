             India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[23] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest
             country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean
             on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan
             to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is
             in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar
             and Indonesia.

            Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[24] Their long occupation,
            initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human
            genetic diversity.[25] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago,
            evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[26] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit,
            an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest,[27] unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and recording
            the dawning of Hinduism in India.[28] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[29] By
            400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[30] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming
            social orders unlinked to heredity.[31] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based
            in the Ganges Basin.[32] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[33] but also marked by the declining
            status of women,[34] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[g][35] In South India, the Middle
            kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[36]
            
            In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism put down roots on India's southern and western coasts.
            [37] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains,[38] eventually establishing the Delhi
            Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[39] In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara
            Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[40] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting
            institutionalised religion.[41] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[42] leaving a legacy of
            luminous architecture.[h][43] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial
            economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[44] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted
            slowly,[45] but technological changes were introduced, and ideas of education, modernity and the public life took root.
            [46] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major
            factor in ending British rule.[47] In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions, a 
            Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented 
            migration.[48][49]
            
            India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed in a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual 
            and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1.211 billion in 2011.[50] During the same time, 
            its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a 
            comparatively destitute country in 1951,[51] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology 
            services, with an expanding middle class.[52] It has a space programme which includes several planned or completed 
            extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.
            [53] India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.
            [54] India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, 
            Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[55] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender 
            inequality, child malnutrition,[56] and rising levels of air pollution.[57] India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity 
            hotspots.[58] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[59] India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with 
            tolerance in India's culture,[60] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.

            <h3 id="hb"><b><u>Etymology: </u></b></h3>Etymology
            Main article: Names of India
            According to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name "India" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a 
            reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east; and in turn derived successively from: Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία); 
            ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός); Old Persian Hindush, an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire; and ultimately its cognate, the 
            Sanskrit Sindhu, or "river," specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[61][62] The ancient 
            Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which translates as "The people of the Indus".[63]

            The term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] (About this soundlisten)), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of 
            India,[64][65] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which 
            applied originally to northern India,[66][67] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[64][68]

            Hindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] (About this soundlisten)) is a Middle Persian name for India, introduced during the Mughal Empire and used 
            widely since. Its meaning has varied, referring to a region encompassing present-day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its 
            near entirety.[64][68][69]

            An illustration from an early-modern manuscript of the Sanskrit epic Ramayana, composed in story-telling fashion c. 400 BCE – c. 
            300 CE.[71]
            By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had 
            earlier evolved.[72][73][74] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[75] After 6500 BCE, 
            evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus 
            appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan.[76] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley 
            Civilisation,[77][76] the first urban culture in South Asia,[78] which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan and 
            western India.[79] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of 
            subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[78]

            During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.
            [80] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[81] were composed during this period,[82] and historians have 
            analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[80] Most historians also consider this 
            period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[81] The caste system, 
            which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their 
            occupations impure, arose during this period.[83] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the 
            existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[80] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the 
            large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[84] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, 
            and craft traditions.[84]

<pre id="b">
Cave 26 of the rock-cut Ajanta Caves, 5th century CE
In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions
had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[85][86] The emerging urbanisation
gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the
life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[87] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes 
excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.
[88][89][90] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[91] and both established 
long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other 
states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[92] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except 
the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[93][94] The Mauryan kings 
are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism 
and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.[95][96]

The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by 
the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and 
South-East Asia.[97][98] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased 
subordination of women.[99][92] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration 
and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[100][101] Under the Guptas, 
a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[102] This renewal was 
reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[101] Classical Sanskrit 
literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[101]

<h3 id="hc"><b><u>Medieval India: </u></b></h3>

The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[103] When 
Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he 
was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[104] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was 
defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[104] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated 
by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther 
south.[104] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond 
their core region.[103] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing 
agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[105] 
The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[105]

In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[106] They were 
imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern 
languages of the subcontinent.[106] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew 
citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[107] Temple towns 
of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[107] By the 8th and 
9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems 
were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, 
Philippines, Malaysia, and Java.[108] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved 
in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian 
seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[10]

After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast 
armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading 
eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[109] The sultanate was to control 
much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian 
elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[110][111] 
By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation 
visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, 
learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby 
creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[112][113] The sultanate's raiding and weakening 
of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[114] 
Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, 
the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[115] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[11

In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[116] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower 
of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[117] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to 
rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[118][119] and diverse and inclusive ruling 
elites,[120] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[121] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, 
especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, 
to an emperor who had near-divine status.[120] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from 
agriculture[122] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[123] caused peasants and artisans 
to enter larger markets.[121] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor 
in India's economic expansion,[121] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.
[124] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained 
military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition 
and military experience.[125] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites 
along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[125] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek 
and control their own affairs.[126]

The Government of India comprises three branches:[235]

Executive: The President of India is the ceremonial head of state,[236] who is elected indirectly for a five-year term by an electoral 
college comprising members of national and state legislatures.[237][238] The Prime Minister of India is the head of government 
and exercises most executive power.[239] Appointed by the president,[240] the prime minister is by convention supported by the 
party or political alliance having a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.[239] The executive of the Indian government 
consists of the president, the vice president, and the Union Council of Ministers—with the cabinet being its executive committee—headed 
by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament.[236] In the Indian 
parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly responsible 
to the lower house of the parliament. Civil servants act as permanent executives and all decisions of the executive are implemented by them.[241]
Legislature: The legislature of India is the bicameral parliament. Operating under a Westminster-style parliamentary system, it comprises
an upper house called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of the People).[242] The Rajya 
Sabha is a permanent body of 245 members who serve staggered six-year terms.[243] Most are elected indirectly by the state and union 
territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population.[240] All but two of the Lok 
Sabha's 545 members are elected directly by popular vote; they represent single-member constituencies for five-year terms.[244] 
Two seats of parliament, reserved for Anglo-Indian in the article 331, have been scrapped.[245][246]
Judiciary: India has a three-tier unitary independent judiciary[247] comprising the supreme court, headed by the Chief Justice of 
India, 25 high courts, and a large number of trial courts.[247] The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases 
involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has appellate jurisdiction over the high 
courts.[248] It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution,[249] and invalidate 
any government action it deems unconstitutional.[250]
Administrative divisions
Main article: Administrative divisions of India
See also: Political integration of India
India is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories (listed below as 1–28 and A–H, respectively).[251] 
All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, 
have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance. The remaining five union territories 
are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, 
states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[252] There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, 
block, district and village levels.[253]
