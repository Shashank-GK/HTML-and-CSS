               <p>
                <b> Chitradurga </b>gets its name from Chitrakaldurga (meaning picturesque fort), an umbrella-shaped lofty hill found here. Chitradurga was also known by the names Chitradurg, Chitrakaladurga, and Chittaldurg. 
                Chittaldrug (or Chitaldrug[2] or Chittledroog) was the official name used during the period of British rule. It was also known as Farkhabad during Tippu sultan rule.[4]

                <h4><u>History</u></h4>
                <p>
                Chitradurga features bold rock hills and picturesque valleys, with huge towering boulders in numerous shapes. It is known as the "stone fortress" (Kallina Kote). According to the epic Mahabharatha, a 
                man-eating <u>Rakshasa named Hidimba</u> and his sister Hidimbi lived on the hill. Hidimba was a source of terror to everyone around, while Hidimbi was a peace-loving rakshasa. When the Pandavas came with 
                their mother Kunti in the course of their exile, Bhima had a duel with Hidimba in which Hidimba was killed. Bhima married Hidimbi and they had a son named Ghatotkacha, who had magical powers. Legend 
                has it the boulders were part of the arsenal used by Bhima during that duel. The boulders on which a major part of the city was developed belong to the oldest rock formation in the country.

                  <u>Timmana Nayaka</u>, a chieftain under the Vijayanagar Empire, was appointed as governor of Chitradurga as a reward from the Vijayanagara ruler for his excellence in military services. This was the 
                beginning of the rule of the Nayakas of Chitradurga. His son Obana Nayaka is known by the name Madakari Nayaka (1588 CE). (He was the last ruler of Chitradurga. His name comes from his ability to 
                have suppressed the arrogance- "Mada" of a particular troublesome elephant- "Kari"). Madakari Nayaka's son Kasturi Rangappa (1602) succeeded him and consolidated the kingdom to rule peacefully. 
                As he had no heirs to succeed him, his adopted son, the apparent heir, was enthroned. But he was killed a few months later by the Dalavayis.
                Chikkanna Nayaka (1676), the brother of Madakari Nayaka II, served on the throne. His brother succeeded him in 1686 with the title Madakari Nayaka III. The Dalawayis overthrow of Madakari Nayaka III's 
                rule gave an opportunity to one of their distant relatives, Bharamappa Nayaka, to ascend the throne in 1689. He is known as the greatest of the Nayaka rulers. The subjects of Chitradurga suffered through 
                the brief reigns of the successive rulers, which resulted in volatile conditions. The Hiri Madakari Nayaka IV (1721), Kasturi Rangappa Nayaka II (1748), Madakari Nayaka V (1758) ruled this area, but there 
                is not much documentation of their rule.[5]
